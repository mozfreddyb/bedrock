        That shopping rabbit hole you started on your laptop this morning? Pick
        up where you left off on your phone tonight. That dinner recipe you
        discovered at lunchtime? Open it on your kitchen tablet, instantly.

      <p>
        Your Firefox Account is the doorway to all your web stuff—we help you
        keep it safe. Your data is always in your control, unreadable by anyone
        else, and encrypted with your account password. We protect it and hand
        you the key.

      <h3>Accessible</h3>
      <p>
        Catch up on your open tabs and saved reads over Saturday morning coffee.
        Find your bookmarks and passwords anywhere you use Firefox—your
        smartphone, tablet or laptop. Connect everything you need and nothing
        you don’t.
      </p>
